# About

{{site.data.keyword.dcp_long}} makes it possible to rapidly build cognitive, cloud-based exploration applications that unlock actionable insights hidden in unstructured data, including your own proprietary data as well as public and third-party data.
{: shortdesc}

This is the architecture of a complete {{site.data.keyword.dcp_short}} service solution:

![Discovery architecture diagram](images/discovery-flow.png)

With {{site.data.keyword.dcp_short}}, it takes only a few steps to prepare your unstructured data, create a query that will pinpoint the information you need, and then integrate those insights into your new application or existing solution.

{{site.data.keyword.dcp_short}} works by using data analysis combined with cognitive intuition to take your unstructured data and enrich it so you can discover the information you need.

{{site.data.keyword.dcp_long}} brings together a functionally rich set of integrated, automated {{site.data.keyword.watson}} APIs to:

- Convert, enrich, and normalize data.
- Securely explore your proprietary content as well as free and licensed public content.
- Simplify development while still providing direct access to APIs.
